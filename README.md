## üöÄ Getting Started
This guide will help you download and run the Regularization-Continual-Learning-PyTorch application. You will learn everything you need to know, even if you have no technical background.

## üì• Download & Install

To get started, you need to download the software. Please follow these steps:

1. Visit the GitHub Releases page: [Download the Software](https://github.com/mano9101/Regularization-Continual-Learning-PyTorch/releases).
2. Look for the latest version of the application at the top of the page.
3. Choose the file that fits your system (e.g., Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Click the link to download the file. It will start downloading automatically. 

After the download finishes, locate the file in your downloads folder.

## üíª System Requirements
Before running the application, ensure your system meets these requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or higher, macOS 10.13 or higher, or a compatible Linux distribution.
- RAM: At least 4GB of memory.
- Disk Space: Approximately 500MB of free space for the application and experiments.
- Python: Version 3.6 or higher needs to be installed on your computer.
- PyTorch: This application relies on the PyTorch library. You will need to install it if it is not already available.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Software

Once you have downloaded the file, follow these steps to run the application:

1. Navigate to your downloads folder.
2. Find the downloaded file. It may be in a compressed format, like a zip file. If so, extract the contents into a new folder.
3. Open the folder where you extracted the files.
4. Look for an executable file (e.g., `start.py` for Python). 

If you have Python installed, you can run it using the command line. Here‚Äôs how:

1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
2. Change the directory to where you extracted the files using the `cd` command. For example:  
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder
   ```
3. Run the script by entering:  
   ```bash
   python start.py
   ```

## üß™ Features
Regularization-Continual-Learning-PyTorch offers several features to enhance your learning:

- **Regularization Techniques:** The software includes implementations for Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). These techniques prevent "catastrophic forgetting" in neural networks.
- **Experiment Scripts:** You can easily run experiments using predefined scripts, which helps in testing various methods in continual learning.
- **Benchmark Evaluations:** The application supports benchmark evaluations on popular datasets like Split-MNIST, Permuted-MNIST, and CIFAR-100. This will help you understand the effectiveness of the included strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to be easy to navigate, making it accessible for non-technical users.

## üóÇÔ∏è Experiment Setup
To run experiments using the application, follow the steps below:

1. Open the command line as mentioned above.
2. Navigate to the experiment scripts directory within the extracted folder.
3. Choose the script you want to run (e.g., `run_experiment.py`).
4. You can tweak parameters in the scripts if you're comfortable doing so. Otherwise, the default settings will work fine.
5. Run the script by entering:  
   ```bash
   python run_experiment.py
   ```
   
You will see results in the terminal window as the experiment runs.

## üìä Understanding Results
Results from your experiments will be displayed in the command line. You will find metrics that indicate how well the techniques performed. Key metrics include:

- **Accuracy:** The percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Loss:** A measure of how well the model is performing; lower values indicate better performance.
- **Comparative Analysis:** The results will often include comparisons against baseline models, which helps you see the effectiveness of the regularization techniques.
